<h1>Foursquare Rules</h1>

<p class="api-url"><a href="index.html">Back Home</a></p>

<h2>1. Objective</h2>

<div class="example">
    <pre>
The goal is to advance to the highest-ranked square, known as the "King," and avoid being eliminated from the lowest square, known as the "Peasant." </pre>
</div>

<h2>2. Starting Play</h2>

<div class="example">
    <pre>
The player in the highest-ranked square (King) serves the ball by bouncing it once in their square and hitting it into another player's square.
The first serve must be fair—neither excessively difficult nor easy. Special moves, such as spins, tricks, or "blackjack," are not allowed on the first serve.</pre>
</div>

<h2>3. Ball Bounce</h2>

<div class="example">
    <pre>
The ball must bounce once in the receiving player's square before they can hit it. The receiving player must then hit the ball into another square. If a player hits the ball out of the air
without allowing it to bounce, they are out.</pre>
</div>

<h2>4. Elimination</h2>

<div class="example">
    <pre>
A player is eliminated if any of the following occur:
 •	They fail to hit the ball into another square.
 •	The ball bounces more than once in their square.
 •	They hit the ball out of bounds.
 •	They catch or hold the ball (known as a "carry") for more than 2 seconds.
 •	They touch the ball more than 3 times consecutively.
 •	They serve the ball in a way where the other player cannot get it.</pre>
</div>

<h2>5. Blackjack</h2>

<div class="example">
    <pre>
If the ball is in the air coming toward a player, they can catch it and swap places with the player who served the ball. "Blackjack" cannot be used on the first serve.</pre>
</div>

<h2>6. Lines</h2>

<div class="example">
    <pre>
If the ball lands on the line between squares, the play is considered a redo. However, if a player intentionally aims to hit the ball onto the line repeatedly, they are out.</pre>
</div>

<h2>7. Ball Contact</h2>

<div class="example">
    <pre>
Players can hit the ball with their hands or arms. Kicking or using any other part of the body is generally not allowed unless specifically agreed upon before the game begins.</pre>
</div>

<h2>8. Interference</h2>

<div class="example">
    <pre>
If any form of interference occurs during play (such as an object or person obstructing a player’s movement or affecting the ball), the point is considered a redo, and the play
is restarted without any player being penalized.</pre>
</div>

<h2>Additional Rules (to clarify gameplay):</h2>

<div class="example">
    <pre>
•	Re-Entry: Once a player is eliminated, they must wait until the start of the next round to re-enter the game.
•	Ranking Advancement: Players rotate up toward the King’s square as others are eliminated. When a player is eliminated, the next player waiting in line enters the lowest square (Peasant).
•	Disputes: Any disputes regarding plays, such as ball placement or rule violations, are resolved through majority consensus of the remaining players.
•	First Serve Violation: If the first serve is deemed unfair (e.g., trick or spin serve), the serve is redone.</pre>
